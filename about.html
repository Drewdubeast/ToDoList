      Welcome to the about page! I am Drew Wilken, a computer science major at St. Thomas with a love for music, producing music, and also coding and creating. I grew up in Minneapolis and am currently a senior living in Flynn.
      In my freetime I love to make music, play piano, and work on my iPhone apps.
      <br>
      The tools I used to build this site were obviously JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My main resource was from W3 schools, which already had some good examples on all of the requirements, for example, to-do lists. I ended up using a lot of the same styles specified on the site for help.
